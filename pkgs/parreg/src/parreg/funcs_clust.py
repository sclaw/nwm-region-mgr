"""Clustering functions.

This function performs donor-receiver pairing based on clustering using
  k-means clustering (method = "kmeans")
  k-medoids clustering (method = "kmedoids")
  HDBSCAN (method = "hdbscan") - Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise.
     Finds core samples of high density and expands clusters from them.
  BIRCH (method = "birch") - Balanced Iterative Reducing & Clustering with Hierarchy. Scalable for large datasets.
     Order of points in the dataset influences the outcome. Hence interactive resampling is implemented here.

Notes:
  1) the clustering is done in multiple rounds to handle data gaps in attributes
  2) snow and non-snow basins are processed separately
